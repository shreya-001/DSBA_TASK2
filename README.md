This task requires to predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually, from the ‘Iris’ dataset.

Name - Shreya Nair

K means works through the following iterative process:

 1. Pick a value for k the number of clusters to create.
 2. Initialize k (starting points) in your data
 3. Create your clusters. Assign each point to the nearest centroid.
 4. Make your clusters better. Move each centroid to the center of its cluster.
 5. Repeat steps 3–4 until your centroids converge.
