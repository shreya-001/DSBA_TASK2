K means works through the following iterative process:

 Pick a value for k the number of clusters to create.
 Initialize k (starting points) in your data
 Create your clusters. Assign each point to the nearest centroid.
 Make your clusters better. Move each centroid to the center of its cluster.
 Repeat steps 3–4 until your centroids converge.
